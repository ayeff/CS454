###Midterm - 11/01/2015

Teams will create a presentation on a node module listed on npm - https://www.npmjs.com/.


Each team will present for 3-4 minutes. The presentation should cover:

1 - Explain what is your node module?

2 - What problem or problems does your node module solve when using it inside a node application?

3 - Are there any competitor modules - meaning modules that do the same thing or something very similar?
 - If so what are they?
 - How are they different?
 - Are they better or worse?

4 - Where can you find documentation on your module?
 - Does the documentation cover all the methods in the module?
 - Is the documentation lacking in any way?

5 - Additional details?

**Teams should keep in mind as they research their module, that the Final Presentation will need to include unique code examples from each team member.**
